&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Innova per l’Italia” is call  to companies, universities, public and private research centers, associations, cooperatives, consortia, foundations and institutes which, through their technologies, can contribute to the prevention, diagnostics and monitoring for the containment and contrast of the spread of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on the whole national territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is a joint initiative of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Minister for Technological Innovation and Digitization&lt;/a&gt; Paola Pisano, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mise.gov.it/index.php/it/&quot;&gt;Minister of Economic Development&lt;/a&gt;, Stefano Patuanelli, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miur.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Minister of University and Research&lt;/a&gt; Gaetano Manfredi, together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invitalia.it/&quot;&gt;Invitalia&lt;/a&gt; and in support of the structure of the &lt;strong&gt;Extraordinary Commissioner for the Coronavirus Emergency&lt;/strong&gt;, Domenico Arcuri.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these weeks, the Innova per l’Italia initiative will be a repository for “calls to action” that will respond to the &lt;strong&gt;specific needs of other bodies and institutions&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. Ministries, Civil Protection, etc.). On this page, from time to time, we will publish different calls for services and technologies in specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The first “fast call” concerns tele-medicine and data analysis services; it will be online &lt;strong&gt;from Tuesday 24 March at 9 am to Thursday 26 March at 1 pm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-objectives&quot;&gt;The objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our country faces an emergency for which the whole world was not prepared. For this reason, we are faced with the need to provide all possible resources and solutions for the &lt;strong&gt;prevention&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. PPE such as surgical masks, FFP2 / FFP3 masks),  &lt;strong&gt;diagnostics and treatment&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. artificial respirators for intensive care units ), &lt;strong&gt;monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, the “Innova per l’Italia” is a call for all companies, universities, institutions and public and private research centers, associations, cooperatives, associations, foundations and institutions that can contribute through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation or industrial conversion of technologies and processes&lt;/strong&gt;, to increase the availability of:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;personal protective equipment, in particular surgical masks, FFP2 / N95 masks with and without filter, FFP3 / N99 masks compliant with Dir. 93/42, Dir. 89/686, and EN149: 2001 + A1: 2009 or equivalent;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;production of respirators for the treatment of respiratory syndromes, including all the elements that make up the complex system in which the respirators are inserted (valves, displays, …).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For this reason, we wish to address companies that: already produce these goods; can convert, for example, their textile production into manufacturing masks suitable for medical purposes, in compliance with the necessary standards; can exploit their capacity to produce materials suitable for the production or functioning of artificial respirators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The finding of innovative kits or technologies that facilitate the &lt;strong&gt;diagnosis of Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;throat swab and other parts for collection system;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;tools for easy and fast diagnosis, in compliance with the required reliability standards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For this reason, we turn to the companies that operate in the production of swabs suitable for the diagnosis of Covid-19 as well as those that could reconvert or start the production. We also address  those companies that have already started experimenting technologies for an easier and faster diagnosis, compliant with the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Availability of technologies and tools that, in compliance with current legislation, allow or facilitate the monitoring, prevention and control of Covid-19:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;technologies for monitoring, tracking and managing the emergency;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;innovative technologies for the prevention and control of the spread of Covid-19.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are already cutting-edge tools and technologies useful for the prevention and control of the epidemic such as, for example, robots that carry out activities generally done by health workers and drones to disinfect public areas and monitor compliance with health systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For this reason we turn to companies, universities, public and private bodies and research centers, associations, cooperatives, consortia, foundations and institutes  that already have platforms, or can easily adapt them, &lt;strong&gt;algorithms of analysis and artificial intelligence, robots, drones and other technologies&lt;/strong&gt; for monitoring, preventing and controlling Covid-19, which can be used to support patients or  by the Civil Protection and other interested bodies, in compliance with the principles of privacy, security and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;How to apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All companies, associations, universities, research bodies and institutes have the opportunity to join by filling out a form &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovaperlitalia.agid.gov.it/&quot;&gt;on the page of the initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do encourage you to apply but please, &lt;strong&gt;read carefully the purposes and requirements&lt;/strong&gt; so that you may give an active contribution to this project. 
All the proposals will be assessed by the team of the Extraordinary Commissioner. The evaluation team will decide whether to contact the proposing subjects, in consideration of the type of the proposal; in particular, those relating to personal protective equipment and respirators would have priority. This process will move in accordance with scientific evidence and certification and in compliance with the  standards and guidelines of the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some types of proposals, the companies that will be contacted may need to &lt;strong&gt;certify their activities and productions&lt;/strong&gt;, through a suitable network of subjects (for example Universities and Research Centers). In particular, for points 1 and 2, in relation to the prevailing impact on industrial production, the Universities, Bodies and Research Centers, due to their significant social, scientific, technological and territorial support function, will be able to certify requirements of the products developed by the companies. The universities  and research centers, willing to participate, will be included in a list which will subsequently be shared to support the applying companies. The network of participating subjects may subsequently be extended in relation to specific needs.The Conference of Italian University Rectors (CRUI) contributes to the coordination of the activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements-for-participation&quot;&gt;Requirements for participation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the proposals should meet the following criteria:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposers should be companies (startups, SMEs, large companies), public and private bodies and research centers, associations (which can interact with associates able to respond to the specific needs), cooperatives, consortia, foundations and institutes, but  not individuals or professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The  proposals should be ready or achievable in times compatible with the emergency, even without any commitment or obligation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposers  can make available, by self-certification, a significant production capacity and volumes on the national territory or at regional level, in a short time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each proposer should select the area for which is applying, selecting the categories in the form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposal should be accompanied by appropriate information that allows for a quick evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The times, methods and possible quantities for the fulfillment of the proposal should be clearly indicated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposal should be valid for the whole national territory or for one or more regions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The description of the intervention should not be written in a promotional tone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferably, a specific “channel”, which includes the top management of the company or entity, should be provided for the coronavirus emergency initiative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We evaluate the best proposals,  acting together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Minister for Technological Innovation and Digitalization&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/home.html&quot;&gt;Ministry of Health&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iss.it/&quot;&gt;Higher Institute for Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; and an Interdisciplinary Scientific Committee launch together a new initiative &lt;strong&gt;“Innova per l’Italia”&lt;/strong&gt;: a call to the world of business and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three day call has the objective of  finding the &lt;strong&gt;best available digital solutions and technologies&lt;/strong&gt; for telemedicine,  home care applications, and for the “active” monitoring of the risk of contagion.  The adoption and use of these solutions and technologies will be coordinated nationally to better monitoring and contrasting the spread of Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The systemic use of &lt;strong&gt;emerging technologies&lt;/strong&gt; (data analytics, artificial intelligence) and &lt;strong&gt;tele-medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (tele-consultation, tele-monitoring) has proven to be a very effective weapon to monitor and contain the coronavirus epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the need for coordination, today we are launching a call for contributions aimed at public administrations, companies and organizations that have already implemented technological solutions in these areas. We launch a call to evaluate &lt;strong&gt;reliable, ready to use and already available on the market&lt;/strong&gt; technological solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all  the proposals have been collected, the Working Group, which is made up of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/home.html&quot;&gt;Ministry of Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iss.it/&quot;&gt;Higher Institute for Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; and the interdisciplinary scientific committee,  will assess the proposals and provide feedback to the proposer only if the proposal is judged appropriate for its characteristics and  the emergency priority that expects to solve. The ministries proposing &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/innova-per-l-Italia-la-tecnologia-e-l-innovazione-in-campo-contro-l-emergenza-covid-19/&quot;&gt;Innova per l’Italia&lt;/a&gt; will assist the Working Group with the technological aspects and by engaging University and Research institutions, enterprises and  the productive fabric as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the call is to identify technological solutions already implemented in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;apps and technical solutions for &lt;strong&gt;remote assistance of patients&lt;/strong&gt; at home, both for diseases related to COVID-19, and  for other pathologies of chronic nature. This area includes apps and chatbots for health condition self-monitoring suited for all citizens or only for certain groups (such as subjects under fiduciary isolation);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technologies and solutions for &lt;strong&gt;continuous tracking, alerting and timely control&lt;/strong&gt; of the level of people’s exposure to the risk, and consequently, of the evolution of the epidemic. This area includes data analysis tools, hardware and software technologies for health emergency management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-present-the-proposal&quot;&gt;How to present the proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All public and private entities  wishing  to submit their proposal should fill in the form available &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovaperlitalia.agid.gov.it/call2action/index.html&quot;&gt;on the website of the Minister for Technological Innovation and Digitization&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday 24 March at 9 am to Thursday 26 March at 1 pm&lt;/strong&gt;. Only the proposers of the solutions that satisfy the call’s specific objectives and are favourably evaluated by the scientific committee, will be contacted in due times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements-for-participation&quot;&gt;Requirements for participation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Services and solutions should meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposers should be public administrations, companies, public and private entities and research centers, associations (which can interact with associates which are able to respond to these needs), cooperatives, consortia, foundations and institutes, but not individuals or professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposals should be ready and available for implementation in a very short time and compatible with the emergency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferably, a dedicated  “channel” - including the company’s top management or body- should be provided for the coronavirus emergency initiative, including the company’s or the entity’s top management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the two forms should be completed in all its parts, in a clear manner; all questions must be clearly and completely answered. Incomplete applications will not be accepted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed solutions should have:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;High interoperability characteristics or the possibility of integration with company / regional systems and should not be subjected to significant front-end / back-end constraints that would make implementation difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Functionality of interaction with the mobile user, ensuring a reliable definition of the position.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;High interoperability characteristics or possibility of integration with corporate / regional systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In particular, the proposals for  remote assistance must provide effective and user friendly methods for identification, authentication and information processing and / or informed consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tre Ministeri proponenti dell’Iniziativa “&lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/innova-per-l-Italia-la-tecnologia-e-l-innovazione-in-campo-contro-l-emergenza-covid-19/&quot;&gt;Innova per l’Italia&lt;/a&gt;” lanciano oggi, congiuntamente al &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/home.html&quot;&gt;Ministero della Salute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iss.it/&quot;&gt;Istituto Superiore di Sanità&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità&lt;/a&gt; e un comitato scientifico interdisciplinare un nuovo invito al mondo dell’impresa e della ricerca. L’obiettivo è individuare, nei prossimi 3 giorni, &lt;strong&gt;le migliori soluzioni digitali disponibili relativamente ad app di telemedicina e assistenza domiciliare dei pazienti e a tecnologie e strategie basate sulle tecnologie per il monitoraggio “attivo” del rischio di contagio&lt;/strong&gt;, e coordinare a livello nazionale l’adozione e l’utilizzo di queste soluzioni e tecnologie, al fine di migliorare i risultati in termini di monitoraggio e contrasto alla diffusione del Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’uso sistemico delle &lt;strong&gt;tecnologie emergenti&lt;/strong&gt; (data analytics, intelligenza artificiale) e della &lt;strong&gt;telemedicina&lt;/strong&gt; (teleconsulto, televisita) ha già dato prova in altri Paesi del mondo di essere un’arma molto efficace per monitorare e contenere il contagio da coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per rispondere ad un’esigenza di coordinamento oggi lanciamo una call for contributions rivolta alle Pubbliche Amministrazioni, alle aziende e organizzazioni che hanno già realizzato soluzioni tecnologiche in questi due ambiti.  Una chiamata per valutare l’offerta delle soluzioni tecnologiche disponibili sul mercato, affidabili e pronte all’uso. Una volta raccolte le adesioni, il Gruppo di Lavoro costituito da Ministero della Salute, ISS, OMS e un comitato scientifico interdisciplinare provvederà a &lt;strong&gt;valutare le proposte e a contattare i proponenti&lt;/strong&gt; qualora ritenute adatte, compatibilmente alle caratteristiche della proposta e alla priorità emergenziale. I tre ministeri proponenti del programma Innova per l’Italia saranno supporto per il Gruppo di Lavoro in relazione all’importante coinvolgimento di aspetti tecnologici, del tessuto produttivo e delle imprese, del mondo dell’Università e Ricerca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;obiettivi&quot;&gt;Obiettivi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’obiettivo della call è individuare soluzione tecnologiche già realizzate nei seguenti ambiti:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;app e soluzioni tecniche di &lt;strong&gt;teleassistenza per pazienti domestici&lt;/strong&gt;, sia per patologie legate a COVID-19, sia per altre patologie, anche di carattere cronico. Rientrano in questo ambito app, siti web e chatbot per l’automonitoraggio delle condizioni di salute, rivolte a tutti i cittadini o solo ad alcune fasce (come i soggetti sottoposti a isolamento fiduciario);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tecnologie e soluzioni per &lt;strong&gt;il tracciamento continuo, l’alerting e il controllo tempestivo&lt;/strong&gt; del livello di esposizione al rischio delle persone e conseguentemente dell’evoluzione dell’epidemia sul territorio. Rientrano in questo ambito sistemi di analisi dati, tecnologie hardware e software utili per la gestione dell’emergenza sanitaria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;informazioni-per-la-partecipazione&quot;&gt;Informazioni per la partecipazione&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutti i soggetti pubblici e privati che vogliono sottoporre una soluzione possono &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovaperlitalia.agid.gov.it/call2action/index.html&quot;&gt;compilare un form dedicato&lt;/a&gt; relativamente ai due temi evidenziati, disponibile &lt;strong&gt;da martedì 24 marzo ore 13 a giovedì 26 marzo ore 13&lt;/strong&gt;. Verranno contattati solo i proponenti di soluzioni compatibili con i requisiti per la partecipazione e ritenute adatte dal gruppo di lavoro, in tempi e modi compatibili con le caratteristiche della proposta e la priorità emergenziale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requisiti-per-la-partecipazione&quot;&gt;Requisiti per la partecipazione&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saranno considerati solo i servizi e interventi che rispondano ai seguenti criteri:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I proponenti siano Pubbliche Amministrazioni, aziende, enti e centri di ricerca pubblici e privati, associazioni (che possono interagire con associati in grado di rispondere a queste esigenze), cooperative, consorzi, fondazioni e istituti, quindi non singole persone o professionisti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siano concrete proposte già realizzate e disponibili per l’implementazione in tempi estremamente brevi e compatibili con l’emergenza.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferibilmente, sia previsto un “canale” specifico dedicato all’iniziativa per l’emergenza coronavirus, che includa il top management dell’azienda o Ente.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uno dei due form sia compilato in tutte le sue parti, in maniera chiara e rispondente alle richieste esplicitate. Non saranno prese in considerazione le proposte incomplete.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;caratteristiche di alta interoperabilità o possibilità di integrazione con i sistemi aziendali/regionali e non siano soggetti a significativi vincoli di front-end/back-end che renderebbero difficile l’implementazione;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;funzionalità di interazione con l’utente mobile, garantendo un affidabile definizione della posizione;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;caratteristiche di alta interoperabilità o possibilità di integrazione con i sistemi aziendali/regionali.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In particolare, le proposte relative alla teleassistenza devono prevedere modalità efficaci e user friendly per identificazione, autenticazione e trattamento informativa e/o consenso informato.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Innova per l’Italia” è un invito alle aziende, università, enti e centri di ricerca pubblici e privati, associazioni, cooperative, consorzi, fondazioni e istituti che, attraverso le proprie tecnologie, possono fornire un contributo nell’ambito dei &lt;strong&gt;dispositivi per la prevenzione, la diagnostica e il monitoraggio&lt;/strong&gt; per il contenimento e il contrasto del diffondersi del Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sull’intero territorio nazionale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il progetto è un’iniziativa congiunta del &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Ministro per l’innovazione tecnologica e la digitalizzazione&lt;/a&gt; Paola Pisano, del &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mise.gov.it/index.php/it/&quot;&gt;Ministro dello Sviluppo Economico&lt;/a&gt; Stefano Patuanelli e del &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miur.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Ministro dell’Università e Ricerca&lt;/a&gt; Gaetano Manfredi, insieme a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invitalia.it/&quot;&gt;Invitalia&lt;/a&gt;  e a sostegno della struttura del &lt;strong&gt;Commissario Straordinario per l’emergenza Coronavirus Domenico Arcuri&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All’interno del programma Innova per l’Italia saranno anche aperte delle “call to action” specifiche e di breve durata che risponderanno alle &lt;strong&gt;esigenze di altri enti e istituzioni&lt;/strong&gt; (es. Ministeri, Protezione civile, ecc) nei tre ambiti di riferimento del programma. In questa pagina pubblicheremo di volta in volta gli avvisi per altre call di servizi e tecnologie in ambiti specifici.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;La prima “fast call” che abbiamo pubblicato riguarda &lt;a href=&quot;/telemedicina-e-sistemi-di-monitoraggio-una-call-per-tecnologie-per-il-contrasto-alla-diffusione-del-covid-19/&quot;&gt;i servizi di telemedicina e data analysis&lt;/a&gt;, e sarà online &lt;strong&gt;da martedì 24 marzo ore 13 a giovedì 26 marzo ore 13&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gli-obiettivi&quot;&gt;Gli obiettivi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il nostro Paese deve affrontare un’emergenza alla quale tutto il mondo non era preparato. Per questo ci troviamo davanti alla necessità di approntare tutti i mezzi e le soluzioni possibili, nell’ambito della &lt;strong&gt;prevenzione&lt;/strong&gt; (es. DPI quali mascherine chirurgiche,  mascherine FFP2/FFP3),  &lt;strong&gt;diagnostica e trattamento&lt;/strong&gt; (es. respiratori artificiali per le unità di terapia intensiva), &lt;strong&gt;monitoraggio&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A questo scopo, “Innova per l’Italia” invita all’azione tutte le aziende, università, enti e centri di ricerca pubblici e privati, associazioni, cooperative, consorzi, fondazioni e istituti che possono contribuire, attraverso:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Il reperimento, l’innovazione o la riconversione industriale delle proprie tecnologie e processi&lt;/strong&gt;, per accrescere la disponibilità di:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dispositivi di protezione individuale, in particolare mascherine chirurgiche, mascherine FFP2/N95 con e senza filtro, mascherine FFP3/N99 conforme con Dir. 93/42 CEE, direttiva europea 89/686, e EN149:2001+A1:2009 o equivalenti;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;produzione dei sistemi complessi dei respiratori per il trattamento delle sindromi respiratorie, inclusi tutti gli elementi che compongono il sistema complesso in cui i respiratori si inseriscono (valvole, display, …).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Per questo motivo ci rivolgiamo alle aziende che già producono questi beni oppure quelle che, ad esempio, possano convertire la propria produzione tessile per la manifattura di mascherine adatte agli scopi medici e nel rispetto degli standard necessari, oppure che possano sfruttare la propria capacità di produrre materiali adatti alla produzione o al funzionamento dei respiratori artificiali.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Il reperimento di kit o tecnologie innovative che facilitino la &lt;strong&gt;diagnosi del Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt; in termini di:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;tamponi e elementi accessori;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;strumenti per la diagnosi facilitata e veloce, nel rispetto degli standard di affidabilità richiesta.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Per questo motivo ci rivolgiamo alle aziende che operano nella produzione dei tamponi adatti alla diagnosi del Covid-19 così come quelle che potrebbero indirizzare la produzione. Ci rivolgiamo anche a quelle aziende che hanno già avviato sperimentazione e innovazione di tecnologie per una diagnosi facilitata e veloce,coerentemente con gli standard necessari definiti.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disponibilità di &lt;strong&gt;tecnologie e strumenti&lt;/strong&gt; che, nel rispetto della normativa vigente, &lt;strong&gt;consentano o facilitino il monitoraggio, la prevenzione e il controllo del Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;, in termini di:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;tecnologie e strumenti per il monitoraggio, la localizzazione e la gestione dell’emergenza;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;tecnologie innovative per la prevenzione e il controllo della diffusione del Covid-19 nelle sue diverse forme.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;L’innovazione offre strumenti e tecnologie all’avanguardia utili per la prevenzione e il controllo dell’epidemia quali, a titolo esemplificativo, robot che svolgono attività generalmente effettuate dagli operatori sanitari e droni per disinfettare le aree pubbliche e monitorare il rispetto dei presidi sanitari.&lt;br /&gt;
  Per questo motivo ci rivolgiamo anche ad &lt;strong&gt;alle  aziende, università, enti e centri di ricerca pubblici e privati, associazioni, cooperative, consorzi, fondazioni e istituti&lt;/strong&gt;, in modo singolo o associato, che hanno già a disposizione piattaforme o le possono in brevissimo tempo adattare, &lt;strong&gt;tecniche e algoritmi di analisi e intelligenza artificiale, robot, droni e altre tecnologie&lt;/strong&gt; per il monitoraggio, la prevenzione e il controllo del Covid-19 nel rispetto dei principi della privacy, sicurezza ed etica, che possano essere utilizzati per il supporto ai pazienti così come dalla Protezione Civile e gli altri Enti interessati.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;informazioni-per-la-partecipazione&quot;&gt;Informazioni per la partecipazione&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutte le aziende, le associazioni, le Università, gli Enti di ricerca e gli Istituti hanno la possibilità di aderire compilando &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovaperlitalia.agid.gov.it/&quot;&gt;un form nella pagina dedicata all’iniziativa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vi preghiamo di aderire in molti ma al tempo stesso &lt;strong&gt;di verificare le finalità e i requisiti&lt;/strong&gt; per una reale ed effettiva capacità di contribuire a questo progetto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le proposte verranno valutate dalla struttura del Commissario Straordinario, che deciderà se attivarsi per i passi successivi mettendosi in contatto con i soggetti proponenti, in considerazione della tipologia di proposta e urgenza emergenziale, in particolare quelle relative ai dispositivi di protezione individuale e respiratori che rivestono assoluta priorità. Tale processo si muoverà in conformità con le evidenze scientifiche e con le necessità di certificazione nel rispetto degli standard necessari e delle linee guida dell’Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per alcune tipologie di proposte, le aziende potrebbero necessitare di &lt;strong&gt;certificare le proprie attività e produzioni&lt;/strong&gt;, tramite opportuna rete di soggetti (ad esempio Università, Enti di Ricerca).  In particolare, per i punti 1 e 2 , in relazione al prevalente impatto sulla produzione industriale, le Università, gli Enti e Centri di Ricerca, per la loro rilevante funzione sociale,  scientifica,  tecnologica e di supporto territoriale, potranno supportare le attività di attestazione dei requisiti dei prodotti sviluppati dalla aziende. Le Università, gli Enti e Centri di Ricerca disponibili saranno inclusi in un elenco che sarà successivamente condiviso per dare supporto alle aziende rispondenti. La rete di soggetti partecipanti potrà essere successivamente estesa in relazione alle necessità. La Conferenza Rettori Università Italiane e gli Enti di ricerca contribuiscono al coordinamento delle attività.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requisiti-per-la-partecipazione&quot;&gt;Requisiti per la partecipazione&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saranno considerati &lt;strong&gt;solo i servizi e interventi che rispondano ai seguenti criteri&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I proponenti siano aziende (startup, PMI, grandi imprese), enti e centri di ricerca pubblici e privati, associazioni (che possono interagire con associati in grado di rispondere a queste esigenze), cooperative, consorzi, fondazioni e istituti, quindi non singole persone o professionisti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siano concrete proposte realizzabili in &lt;strong&gt;tempi compatibili&lt;/strong&gt; con l’emergenza, pur senza alcun impegno od obbligo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Possano mettere a disposizione, autocertificandosi, una componente significativa in termini di &lt;strong&gt;capacità produttiva e volumi&lt;/strong&gt; per l’impiego sul territorio nazionale o a livello regionale in tempi brevi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sia esplicitato a quale ambito si desideri aderire tra quelle rientranti nelle categorie proposte nel form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La proposta sia corredata da opportune informazioni che consentano di valutare in tempi rapidi l’effettiva applicabilità.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siano indicati i tempi, le modalità e le possibili quantità per la realizzazione della proposta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siano validi per tutto il territorio nazionale o per una o più regioni.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La descrizione dell’intervento non sia redatta in tono promozionale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferibilmente, sia previsto un “canale” specifico dedicato all’iniziativa per l’emergenza coronavirus, che includa il top management dell’azienda o Ente.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un percorso semplificato per permettere alle Pubbliche Amministrazioni di &lt;strong&gt;attivare rapidamente servizi digitali per i cittadini e per le imprese&lt;/strong&gt; e per consentire ai propri dipendenti di lavorare a distanza è stato approvato dal governo nell’ambito di un pacchetto di misure per contrastare l’emergenza legata al Covid-19 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2020/03/17/20G00034/sg&quot;&gt;Decreto legge 16 marzo 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Di fronte all’urgenza che stiamo vivendo in questi giorni&lt;/em&gt;”, ha detto &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/it/chi-siamo/ministro/&quot;&gt;il ministro per l’Innovazione Tecnologica e la digitalizzazione&lt;/a&gt; Paola Pisano, “&lt;em&gt;Le misure introdotte oggi permetteranno di accelerare molto la modernizzazione della dotazione tecnologica della Pubblica Amministrazione, consentendo il rapido acquisto di servizi che possano garantire il lavoro agile dei dipendenti e l’erogazione di servizi online per i cittadini e le imprese&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il Decreto approvato introduce &lt;strong&gt;fino al 31 dicembre 2020&lt;/strong&gt; un processo facilitato per tutte le Pubbliche Amministrazioni per acquisire beni e servizi digitali, con particolare riferimento a servizi che operano in cloud (Software-as-a-Service, come ad esempio servizi di hosting, ma anche applicazioni, servizi che permettono il telelavoro, o servizi diretti al cittadino e alle imprese). Gli enti potranno acquistare questi beni e servizi con una procedura negoziata ma &lt;strong&gt;senza bando di gara e in deroga ad ogni disposizione di legge&lt;/strong&gt; diversa da quella penale, fatto salvo il rispetto delle disposizioni del codice delle leggi antimafia. Le principali condizioni sono che:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;il fornitore dei servizi venga selezionato &lt;strong&gt;tra almeno quattro operatori economici&lt;/strong&gt;, di cui una &lt;strong&gt;startup innovativa&lt;/strong&gt; o una &lt;strong&gt;piccola e media impresa innovativa&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gli acquisti di beni e servizi riguardino progetti coerenti con il Piano triennale per l’informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione e debbano essere integrati (quando possibile) con &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/pianotriennale-ict-doc/it/2019-2021/06_piattaforme.html&quot;&gt;le piattaforme abilitanti&lt;/a&gt; come &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/it/progetti/spid/&quot;&gt;Spid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/it/progetti/pagopa/&quot;&gt;pagoPA&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/it/progetti/anpr/&quot;&gt;ANPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Con questa disposizione vogliamo accelerare e semplificare al massimo i procedimenti burocratici per l’acquisto di beni informatici e servizi digitali, in un momento in cui sono particolarmente strategici e importanti per tutto il Paese&lt;/em&gt;”, ha detto ancora Pisano. “&lt;em&gt;L’accelerazione della trasformazione digitale, nel rispetto delle disposizioni dell’agenda digitale e con particolare attenzione ai servizi cloud, può essere una risposta davvero efficace all’emergenza&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il provvedimento nasce a fronte di un momento critico per il Paese, ma crea al tempo stesso condizioni che possano &lt;strong&gt;accelerare in modo strutturale la trasformazione digitale del Paese&lt;/strong&gt;. Per questo tutti i beni e i servizi digitali dovranno rispettare le indicazioni del Piano Triennale e la norma è costruita per dare impulso al mercato con una richiesta aperta di servizi digitali e in cloud a tutte le aziende in grado di produrli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Ministro per l’innovazione tecnologica e la digitalizzazione&lt;/a&gt; lancia oggi un nuovo progetto di “solidarietà digitale”, esteso a tutto il territorio nazionale, con l’obiettivo di aiutare le persone, i professionisti e le aziende a continuare la propria attività e mantenere le proprie abitudini di vita, rispettando al tempo stesso le disposizioni del nuovo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.governo.it/it/articolo/firmato-il-dpcm-9-marzo-2020/14276&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Decreto del Presidente del consiglio dei ministri&lt;/a&gt; (Dpcm 9 marzo 2020) che introduce misure per il contenimento e il contrasto del diffondersi del Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sull’intero territorio nazionale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A fronte del nuovo decreto che ha esteso le misure di prevenzione e contenimento a tutto il territorio italiano”&lt;/em&gt;, ha detto il ministro Paola Pisano, &lt;em&gt;“abbiamo deciso di estendere a tutta Italia anche il nostro &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/coronavirus-la-digitalizzazione-a-supporto-delle-zone-rosse/&quot;&gt;progetto di solidarietà digitale&lt;/a&gt; lanciato nei giorni scorsi”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gli-obiettivi&quot;&gt;Gli obiettivi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’iniziativa nasce da due considerazioni:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbiamo tutti il dovere di &lt;strong&gt;restare a casa&lt;/strong&gt; se non è indispensabile uscire, per limitare al massimo la diffusione del virus. Una responsabilità collettiva a cui non ci dobbiamo sottrarre.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Il digitale e l’innovazione sono alleati preziosi per farci vivere &lt;strong&gt;un quotidiano sostenibile&lt;/strong&gt;, migliorando la  nostra qualità della vita nonostante le limitazioni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per questo l’iniziativa riguarda servizi gratuiti rivolti a cittadini, professionisti e aziende, che permettono di:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lavorare da remoto, attraverso &lt;strong&gt;connettività rapida e gratuita&lt;/strong&gt; e l’utilizzo di &lt;strong&gt;piattaforme di smart working avanzate&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leggere gratuitamente un giornale anche senza andare in edicola o un libro senza andare in libreria &lt;strong&gt;sul proprio smartphone o tablet&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;restare al passo con i percorsi scolastici e di formazione, grazie a &lt;strong&gt;piattaforme di e-learning&lt;/strong&gt;, come &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miur.gov.it/web/guest/-/coronavirus-pubblicate-due-call-per-sostenere-la-didattica-a-distanza&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;proposto dal Ministero dell’Istruzione&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;usufruire di servizi digitali online, come l’accesso a &lt;strong&gt;servizi pubblici o specialistici&lt;/strong&gt;, come ad esempio una consulenza medica o professionale;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;svolgere a distanza &lt;strong&gt;attività della vita di tutti i giorni&lt;/strong&gt;, come fare la spesa, attività sportiva, ma anche la socialità, la vita politica e quella religiosa, l’associazionismo, o persino gli hobby, come le arti o la cucina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;come-partecipare&quot;&gt;Come partecipare&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A causa della grande risposta all'iniziativa sulla solidarietà digitale e alle centinaia di offerte che stanno arrivando, l’istruttoria e la pubblicazione potrebbero richiedere qualche giorno. Ci scusiamo per l'attesa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se hai un servizio &lt;strong&gt;da offrire gratuitamente per un periodo di tempo limitato&lt;/strong&gt; a tutta la popolazione italiana o solo in alcune regioni e che rientra negli obiettivi dell’iniziativa che abbiamo elencato, compila subito il form presente nella sezione &lt;em&gt;“Come aderire”&lt;/em&gt; all’interno della pagina &lt;a href=&quot;https://solidarietadigitale.agid.gov.it/#come-aderire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Solidarietà Digitale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nella &lt;a href=&quot;https://solidarietadigitale.agid.gov.it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;stessa pagina dedicata all’iniziativa&lt;/a&gt;, tutti i cittadini possono trovare un &lt;strong&gt;elenco di servizi a loro disposizione&lt;/strong&gt; e le istruzioni per attivarli o farne richiesta (quando necessario).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;requisiti-per-la-pubblicazione-dei-servizi&quot;&gt;Requisiti per la pubblicazione dei servizi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saranno pubblicati, previa verifica, &lt;strong&gt;solo i servizi, esclusivamente digitali, che rispondano ai seguenti criteri&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i proponenti siano aziende, enti o associazioni, quindi non singole persone o professionisti;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;siano servizi non di consulenza resi gratuiti per l’emergenza (non scontistica), senza alcun impegno od obbligo di rinnovo al termine del periodo dell’offerta;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sia esplicitata la durata dell’offerta;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rientrino nelle categorie proposte nel form;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;siano validi per tutto il territorio nazionale o per una o più regioni;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;la cui descrizione non sia redatta in tono promozionale;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;preferibilmente, sia previsto un canale di adesione dedicato all’iniziativa per l’emergenza coronavirus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt-4&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Che siate una multinazionale o una partecipata pubblica, una startup, una piccola o media impresa, o un’associazione di volontari, se pensate di disporre di una soluzione, di un servizio capace di &lt;strong&gt;fare la differenza&lt;/strong&gt; per garantire un quotidiano sostenibile a chi vive nelle aree sottoposte a misure di contenimento per il virus, scriveteci. Grazie!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitale e innovazione possono rappresentare, se utilizzate nel modo giusto, &lt;strong&gt;risorse preziose per migliorare la vita a cittadini e imprese&lt;/strong&gt;. Oggi l’Italia è chiamata ad affrontare un momento di emergenza sanitaria, per contrastare &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salute.gov.it/nuovocoronavirus&quot;&gt;la diffusione del Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; (SARS-CoV-2), che sta incidendo notevolmente sulla vita di decine di migliaia di persone che si trovano nelle aree sottoposte a restrizioni. Anche in questo contesto difficile, l’innovazione può dare il suo contributo, se non a ritrovare la normalità forzatamente perduta, almeno a trovare &lt;strong&gt;una quotidianità diversa nella quale non dover rinunciare a lavorare, a informarsi, a fare la spesa&lt;/strong&gt;, alla propria socialità e, specie per i più piccoli, al gioco, alla formazione, all’istruzione.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partendo da questa considerazione, come &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovazione.gov.it/&quot;&gt;Ministro per l’innovazione tecnologica e la digitalizzazione&lt;/a&gt; ho deciso di intraprendere una serie di azioni per essere a fianco dei nostri cittadini e delle nostre imprese utilizzando servizi e soluzioni innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gli-obiettivi&quot;&gt;Gli obiettivi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I servizi che vogliamo rendere disponibili hanno il comune obiettivo di &lt;strong&gt;migliorare la vita delle persone&lt;/strong&gt; che in questo momento si vedono costrette a cambiare le loro abitudini  permettendo di:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lavorare da remoto, attraverso &lt;strong&gt;connettività rapida e gratuita&lt;/strong&gt; e l’utilizzo di &lt;strong&gt;piattaforme di &lt;em&gt;smart working&lt;/em&gt; avanzate&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leggere gratuitamente un giornale anche senza andare in edicola o un libro senza andare in libreria &lt;strong&gt;sul proprio smartphone o tablet&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;restare al passo con i percorsi scolastici e di formazione, grazie a &lt;strong&gt;piattaforme di &lt;em&gt;e-learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, come &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miur.gov.it/web/guest/-/coronavirus-pubblicate-due-call-per-sostenere-la-didattica-a-distanza&quot;&gt;proposto dal MIUR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;come-collaborare-con-noi&quot;&gt;Come collaborare con noi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chiunque può aderire all’iniziativa semplicemente compilando il form presente nella sezione &lt;em&gt;“Come aderire”&lt;/em&gt; all’interno della pagina &lt;a href=&quot;https://solidarietadigitale.agid.gov.it/#come-aderire&quot;&gt;Solidarietà Digitale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’Italia è un solo grande Comune e &lt;strong&gt;una situazione come questa ci riguarda tutti&lt;/strong&gt;, nessuno escluso. Digitale e innovazione possono aiutarci a vincere e abbiamo il dovere di provare a usarli nell’interesse comune, nel modo migliore possibile e senza lasciare nessuno indietro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Che siate una multinazionale o una partecipata pubblica, una startup, una piccola o media impresa, o un’associazione di volontari, se pensate di disporre di una soluzione, di un servizio capace di &lt;strong&gt;fare la differenza&lt;/strong&gt; per garantire un quotidiano sostenibile a chi vive nelle aree sottoposte a misure di contenimento per il virus, scriveteci.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grazie,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paola Pisano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ministro per l’innovazione tecnologica e la digitalizzazione&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- MORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sul nostro &lt;strong&gt;Blog per la trasformazione digitale&lt;/strong&gt; abbiamo pubblicato &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/blog-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/inizia-la-rivoluzione-cloud-la-strategia-per-le-infrastrutture-digitali-della-pubblica-eddcd0a8e3f8&quot;&gt;la strategia per le infrastrutture digitali e il cloud&lt;/a&gt;, che abbiamo progettato per migliorare la gestione dei servizi della Pubblica Amministrazione in Italia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La strategia permetterà di ottenere: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servizi digitali pubblici che funzionino&lt;/strong&gt;, che siano moderni, digitali, e che rendano davvero più facile la vita delle persone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Una razionalizzazione delle risorse&lt;/strong&gt;, capace di far risparmiare circa due miliardi di euro ogni anno allo Stato, creando allo stesso tempo enormi &lt;strong&gt;opportunità per nuovi investimenti&lt;/strong&gt; in aree di mercato innovative.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La &lt;strong&gt;messa in sicurezza dei servizi pubblici&lt;/strong&gt; e dei nostri dati, all’interno di infrastrutture funzionanti, efficaci, razionali, che operano all’interno dei confini nazionali secondo i migliori standard di sicurezza fisica e informatica. Secondo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/relazione-annuale/relazione-al-parlamento-2018.html&quot;&gt;la relazione annuale&lt;/a&gt; del Dipartimento delle informazioni per la sicurezza (Dis), nel 2018 sono aumentati del 500 per cento gli attacchi informatici rispetto all’anno precedente, principalmente rivolti a Pubbliche Amministrazioni centrali e locali (72 per cento).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Un impatto importante sull’ambiente, grazie &lt;strong&gt;alla razionalizzazione e alla gestione più efficiente&lt;/strong&gt; dei &lt;em&gt;data center&lt;/em&gt; pubblici che permette una riduzione significativa delle emissioni di CO2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
